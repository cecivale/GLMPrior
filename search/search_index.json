Overview GLMPrior is a package designed to define flexible generalized linear model (GLM) prior distributions for any parameter in a BEAST2 phylodynamic analysis. The GLM has the following general form: \u03bc = g\u207b\u00b9( g(\u03bc\u2080) + \u03b4\u2081\u00b7\u03b2\u2081\u00b7X\u2081 + \u03b4\u2082\u00b7\u03b2\u2082\u00b7X\u2082 + ... + \u03b4\u209a\u00b7\u03b2\u209a\u00b7X\u209a + \u03b5 ) Where: \u03bc is the parameter being modeled (e.g., a rate or probability). \u03bc\u2080 is the baseline value on the natural scale, it can be estimated by the MCMC. g(\u00b7) is the link function: one of log , logit , or identity (default is log ). g\u207b\u00b9(\u00b7) is its inverse. X\u2081, X\u2082, ..., X\u209a are predictors (explanatory variables). These should be carefully selected and appropriately transformed. Scaling is generally recommended. Built-in options for log-transformation and standardization are available in the class (but disabled by default). The order of the elements in each predictor must match the order of the elements in the parameter (package dependent). \u03b2\u2081, ..., \u03b2\u209a are coefficients describing the effect of each predictor. Estimated by the MCMC. They can be estimated by the MCMC. \u03b4\u2081, ..., \u03b4\u209a are optional indicator variables (0 or 1), enabling variable selection. If included, they can be estimated by the MCMC. \u03b5 is an optional error term , modeling residual variation. If included, they can be estimated by the MCMC. Important: The GLMPrior class is implemented as a function within the BEAST2 framework. This means that to use it for your parameter, the BEAST2 package you are applying it to must accept functions as inputs (not only RealParameter objects). Ensure compatibility before setup.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"This page provides a brief guide on how to use the GLMPrior class and how to set it up within BEAUti for BDMM-Prime analyses in BEAST2.

When installing by hand, keep in mind to install the above packages first. From BEAUti Launch BEAUti. Select File -> Manage packages . In the new window at the bottom menu, select Package repositories . Click Add URL , paste the link https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cecivale/GLMPrior/refs/heads/main/package.xml and click OK . Now close the Package Repository Manager window. You should now see GLMPrior package listed among the other packages. Select the GLMPrior package and click Install\\Upgrade . In order to use the combined BDMM-Prime and GLMPrior template you will need to restart BEAUti. By Hand Download the ZIP from the GLMPrior GitHub releases , then unzip and install following the instructions in BEAST2 Package Management . Currently, to use the BEAUti interface of GLMPrior with BDMM-Prime, you need to manually clear the BEAUti class path after manual installation of GLMPrior package. To do so: 1. Launch BEAUti 2. Select File -> Clear class path 3. Restart BEAUti and you should now be able to use combined GLM and BDMM-Prime template. Building from Source Code The below information is largely copied from BDMM-Prime repo . To build GLMPrior from source you'll need the following to be installed: - OpenJDK version 17 or greater - A recent version of OpenJFX - the Apache Ant build system Once these are installed and in your execution path, issue the following command from the root directory of this repository: JAVA_FX_HOME=/path/to/openjfx/ ant The package archive will be left in the dist/ subdirectory. Note that unless you already have a local copy of the latest BEAST 2 source in the directory ../beast2 and the latest BeastFX source in the directory ../beastfx relative to the GLMPrior root, the build script will attempt to download them automatically. Also, other BEAST2 packages that GLMPrior depends on will be downloaded.

Errors may occur, and unexpected behavior is possible. Please follow the setup instructions exactly in the order provided, and avoid navigating back and forth between steps in BEAUti. Doing so may break the setup or result in an invalid XML file. If issues arise, restarting the BEAUti setup from scratch is recommended. Setup Instructions Begin setting up your BDMM-Prime analysis as usual: load your alignment, set tip dates, substitution and clock models. In the Priors panel, select the BDMMPrime tree prior, and set the tip types at the bottom. Choose the parameterization: GLMEpiParameterization (reproductive number, becoming uninfectious rate, sampling proportion), or GLMCanonicalParameterization (birth, death, and sampling rates) from the Parameterization dropdown. For parameters without GLM prior, proceed as usual. For parameters with GLM prior, follow these steps: Specify if the parameter has the same value across all types (\u201cscalar values\u201d, default) or varies (deselect scalar). Specify the number of change times; define change times and related specs. Tick Use GLM next to the parameter. Click Load GLM predictors CSV to select your predictor file(s). Click Show Table to check your predictors. Select/deselect Estimate indicators as appropriate. Select/deselect Estimate error as appropriate. Select/deselect Log transform and Standardize depending on your predictors. Define a sensible prior for \u03bc\u2080 (baseline on natural scale). Leave default priors for coefficients, indicators, and error unless you have reasons to change them. Format Requirements for Predictor Files in BEAUTi (only for BDMM-Prime) CSV format. One predictor per row (you may load one or multiple files; they append predictors). The order of predictor values must match the order of the parameter elements. For BDMM-Prime: elements are ordered alphabetically by type, and if multiple epochs exist, order is by epoch then by type within each epoch. See BDMM-Prime documentation . Note this order varies for other BEAST2 packages. Rows must be named; columns may be named or unnamed.
